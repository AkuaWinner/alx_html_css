        <p>For all Amoako Boafo's head-turning success, he is a reluctant 
            interviewee. Not yet 40, he has had his canvases displayed in 
            the galleries of the mega-dealer Larry Gagosian, who has 
            hailed him as “the future of portraiture”.</p>
    
        <p>Boafo says he used to vie with his friends to see who 
            could do the best drawings of their favourite superheroes, 
            but art simply wasn’t a career choice when he was growing up.</p>

        <p>It was a rare opportunity to catch up with a man who is always 
            on the move, from his base in Vienna to commissions around the 
            world, and perhaps a chance to grab a few words with him.</p>


        <p>He was born in 1984 and his father died when he was very 
            young. His mother worked as a cook and Boafo taught himself 
            to paint while she was out of the house.</p>
